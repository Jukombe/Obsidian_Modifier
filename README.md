## Copy-code-to.md.py
Python script that recursively converts source code files (.py, .html, .js, etc.) into Markdown code blocks, preserving folder structure. Perfect for publishing code in Obsidian, blogs, or documentation sites.

## Delete_Indexes.py
Simple Python tool with a GUI prompt to recursively delete auto-generated index.md files (named after their folder) from a selected directory. Useful for cleaning up Markdown-based folder structures like Obsidian exports.

## copy_folders_to_path.py
Python script to batch copy multiple folders into a target directory while preserving their names. Skips any folders that already exist at the destination. Great for organizing Obsidian vaults or managing content backups.

## create_index_links.py
Python script that auto-generates Index files in selected folders of your Obsidian vault. It links Markdown, PDF, canvas, and code files, and optionally inserts tags based on folder structure. Helps you organize and browse your vault more efficiently.

## remove_obsidian_links.py
Python script with a GUI file picker to remove Obsidian-style wiki links ([[Page]], [[Page|Display]]) from Markdown files, keeping only the display text or page name. Useful for exporting or cleaning vault content.
